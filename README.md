[In the first week, we started with the programming language PYTHON and some libraries associated with it, Numpy and Panda for which we are given a week which includes an assignment to submit. In the second week, they give us a bunch of videos to learn machine learning and again, then we get assignments for the same. This week going on I have completed just Neural Networks and Deep Learning as this week includes two weeks of resources. 
Then we had Assignment 3, which encompasses all the knowledge we have gained in weeks 3 and 4 regarding Neural Networks. This assignment served as a mini-project that allowed us to apply and combine our understanding of the concepts. And it covers all the stuff we learned about deep learning in weeks 4 and 5.
Then, I learned PyTorch from here: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html
After learning PyTorch, I read the Neural Style Transfer paper by referring to online explanations
Now working in a group and reading the final paper and trying to implement it. We can access it at https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576.
